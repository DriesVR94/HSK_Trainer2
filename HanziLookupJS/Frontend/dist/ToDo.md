- [] Make a homepage
- [] Automatically show the next char when you got one correct. 
- [] Make an algorithm that checks how well a character is known by counting the time it takes to write the character. Granted time should be in function of the number of strokes. For example, the feedback bar can be divided into levels. After the character is drawn, the achieved level lights up.
- [] Keep an account of which chars are well-known, lesser-known, unknown, etc.   
- [x] Remove the grid lines from the pictures that are sent to the server.
